# Service Workers Workshop

Hello Berlin DevFest 2016!

This is a platform that will allow us to get started with service workers and learn how to use them quickly.

## Running this locally

To run this locally, you will first need to install the dependencies.

```
npm install

# if you haven't used http-server before

npm i -g http-server
```

Then run:

```
npm run build         # this will build and watch the app
npm start            # this will build and watch the service worker
http-server public    # this will serve both

```

...and you're good to go!
